    "In previous classification missions, categorical variables have been represented in the dataset using integer values (like 0 and 1) for us already. In many cases, like with this dataset, you'll have to create numeric representation of categorical values yourself. For this dataset, categorical variables exist in three columns, cylinders, year, and origin. The cylinders and year columns must be converted to numeric values so we can use them to predict label origin. Even though the column year is a number, we’re going to treat them like categories. The year 71 is unlikely to relate to the year 70 in the same way those two numbers do numerically, but rather just as two different labels. In these instances, it is always safer to treat discrete values as categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must use dummy variables for columns containing categorical values. Whenever we have more than 2 categories, we need to create more columns to represent the categories. Since we have 5 different categories of cylinders, we could use 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 to represent the different categories. We can split the column into separate binary columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cyl_3 -- Does the car have 3 cylinders? 0 if False, 1 if True.\n",
    "    cyl_4 -- Does the car have 4 cylinders? 0 if False, 1 if True.\n",
    "    cyl_5 -- Does the car have 5 cylinders? 0 if False, 1 if True.\n",
    "    cyl_6 -- Does the car have 6 cylinders? 0 if False, 1 if True.\n",
    "    cyl_8 -- Does the car have 8 cylinders? 0 if False, 1 if True.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the pandas.get_dummies() function to return a Dataframe containing binary columns from the values in the cylinders column. In addition, if we set the prefix parameter to cyl, Pandas will pre-pend the column names to match the style we'd like:\n",
